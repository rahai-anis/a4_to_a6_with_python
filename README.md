# a4_to_a6_with_python
This Python tool takes an A4 PDF document as input and divides each page into four smaller pages: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right. It's ideal for applications requiring focused sections of each A4 page, such as creating handouts, extracting segments for study materials, or customizing printable content.
